## Junior Developer - Coding Test

Please find solutions to the Junior Developer coding test in the files corresponding with the problem names in the instructions.

I have chosen to complete the test in Ruby (version ruby 2.7.4).

** Considerations**:
- Parameter and method/function names use Ruby naming convention (lower_snake_case), rather than lowerCamelCase as in the instructions.
- Longest Sequence: as object literals do not exist in Ruby, I have returned a Ruby hash instead.
